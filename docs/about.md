CitizenIV (formerly known as CitizenMP:IV) is a multiplayer modification for the 2008 PC port of Grand Theft Auto IV, which differs from other multiplayer modifications in that it doesn't **reimplement** networking frameworks, but **builds upon** the powerful framework by the Rockstar Studios, as also used in Max Payne 3 and Grand Theft Auto V.

This allows for various features such as full support of the artificial intelligence features as seen in the singleplayer and cooperative gamemodes of IV, near-flawless synchronization of any supported object and is added to by high-level scripting and flexibility features provided by the CitizenFX framework.

The CitizenFX:IV framework is a multiplayer-first framework supporting the CitizenMP modification, but can also be used as a base framework for any other modification as desired by developers anywhere - supporting **great** gameplay experiences.
